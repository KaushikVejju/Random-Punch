# Random-Punch
"Random Punch" is a Java-based game that simulates a fight between two Players.

**Detailed Overview:**
In this game, there are two Players: A Hero and A Villain. Each player is given a health of 1000
and a strength ranging from 200-250. Each player also has a designated special move, which will
aid them in the fighting match. During the game, players are only allowed to land punches or
perform their special moves when they are able to correctly guess a randomly generated number between
1 - 3 (hence the name, Random Punch). The game will go on until one player's health falls below 0.
